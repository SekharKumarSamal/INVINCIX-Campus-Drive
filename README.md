# INVINCIX-Campus-Drive

A mathematician is fed up with complaining to the local authorities that the poles meant for street  lights are all inclined, this is dangerous because the pole could anytime fall off with a little pressure.  The authorities do not agree to this complain and demand for proof. Let’s help the mathematician in  building tool that can calculate the angle of the pole from the surface of the ground. 

In the above image lets say AB is the pole. Give the coordinates, of A and B lets say A(x1,y1) and  B(x2,y2) find the angle of inclination of the pole against the ground surface (x-axis) 
Input:  
X1 – x coordinate of starting point of the pole  
Y1– y coordinate of starting point of the pole 
X2– x coordinate of ending point of the pole 
Y2- y coordinate of ending point of the pole 
Output 
Angle of inclination of the pole from the surface
Example 
Input 
X1 – 0 
Y1 – 0 
X2 – 6 
Y2 – 6 
Output 
Angle of inclination – 45 Degrees
